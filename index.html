                                Vladimir Putin, Russia’s longest-serving leader since Stalin, has shaped modern Russia
                                through strategic policies, military interventions, and strong nationalist rhetoric.
                                Born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) in 1952, he rose through the ranks of the KGB
                                before entering politics.
                                Since becoming president in 2000, Putin has centralized power, reasserted Russia’s
                                influence on the global stage, and remained a dominant figure in international
                                affairs.<br>

                                Vladimir Putin rose to power after serving in the KGB and later as an aide to St. Petersburg’s mayor. In 1999, he became Prime Minister under Boris Yeltsin and was appointed acting President when Yeltsin resigned on December 31, 1999. He won the 2000 presidential election, consolidating power through **economic growth, centralization, and strong nationalism.

                                Vladimir Putin has faced numerous allegations, including political repression, election manipulation, and silencing opposition through arrests and media control. He has been accused of orchestrating poison attacks on critics like Alexei Navalny and interfering in Western elections through cyber warfare. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine led to accusations of war crimes and severe global sanctions. Despite these controversies, Putin maintains a strong grip on power, portraying himself as a defender of Russian sovereignty.

                                Vladimir Putin's major gains include strengthening Russia’s military and reviving its global influence, particularly through the annexation of Crimea in 2014. He boosted the economy in the early 2000s with energy exports and state-controlled industries. His leadership solidified ties with China and expanded Russia’s role in the Middle East, especially in Syria. Domestically, he maintained strong political control, limiting opposition and centralizing power. Despite challenges, he remains a dominant figure in global geopolitics.

                                    When Vladimir Putin was named president in 1999, Russia’s constitution limited
                                    the president to two consecutive terms. That’s why, after his second term ended in
                                    2008, he
                                    served as prime minister before becoming president again in 2012. However, in
                                    January 2020 Putin
                                    drafted a constitutional amendment that would allow him to remain president for two
                                    more terms.
                                    It was included in a package of amendments that was approved by the Russian

                    Vladimir Putin (born October 7, 1952, Leningrad, Russia, U.S.S.R. [now St. Petersburg, Russia]) is a
                    Russian intelligence officer and politician who has served as president (1999–2008 and 2012– ) of
                    Russia and as the country’s prime minister (1999 and 2008–12). One of the 21st century’s most
                    influential leaders, Putin has shaped his country’s political landscape for decades with a mix of
                    strategic maneuvers, military aggression against Russia’s neighbors, and controversial policies.

                    Putin reintroduced highly centralized, top-down control within Russia. He tightened the Kremlin’s
                    grip on mass media and the Internet, and he renationalized key industries; by some estimates, the
                    state came to control as much as 70 percent of the Russian economy. He made it clear to Russia’s
                    oligarchs that their positions were conditional on their personal loyalty to him and their
                    abstention from politics. Putin also tried to assert dominance in the “near abroad”—a Russian term
                    for the former Soviet states on Russia’s borders. Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and launched a
                    proxy war in Ukraine in 2014, prior to a full-scale invasion in 2022.
